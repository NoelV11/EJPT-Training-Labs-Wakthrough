HTTP Sniffing, using Wireshark - Lab

I am currently connected in a VPN, with two other web servers

A HTTP one at http://10.54.15.68
and
A HTTPS one at http://10.54.15.15

We are given credentials:-

Username: elsstudent

Password: testpassword

Objective - Use Wireshark, login to the login page, try to extract the credentials we just inserted

I first go to http://10.54.15.68, where I am presented with a login page - Image H1

I enter the given credentials, but before that, I open up Wireshark,set the interface to 'tap0', and then click on the login

I am successfully authenticated. Let's head back to Wireshark.
REMEMBER: We have made a POST Request(Submission of data), so let's sort the sniffed packets by HTTP

I am given 2 sniffed packets. Analyzing the second packet gives me - Image H2

Well we know that HTTPS cannot be sniffed, so no efforts were made there
