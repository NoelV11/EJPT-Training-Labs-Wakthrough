Burp Suite Basics - Lab

When going to http://172.16.160.102,we find - Image B1

We peer over the source code and find -Image B2

Then heading over to robots.txt, we find - Image B3

Each of these entries only presents "Not found resource", except for /connections, which displays ' Debug is FALSE' - Image B4

From the robots.txt entry, we find an entry named /*?debug=*
What do you understand? - * - wildcard. Anything can come between/ and ?   and anything can come after =

So what we do now, is to set our Proxy to intercept and go to /*?debug=*

We get the intercepted packet - Image B5
Now, send this packet to Repeater

Now manually editing the /destination/path from  /*?debug=* to  /?debug= ,to see if a page actually exists

Hit send and we get back a response of the main page(http://172.16.160.102)

I tried a lot appending numbers, strings, and even symbols after the = sign(NOTE: We were trying to get /?debug=

Changing tactics,we now seek /connections/?debug=

After the equal to sign, I entered a string = pppppppppppppppppp and got back this response - Image B7
So, there is a variable Debug, whose value can be set to TRUE(1) or FALSE(0)

So, we need to tamper more, to get the secret credentials.
I tampered, I got - I tried inserting =TRUE after /connections/?debug

I got this- Image 8 - Looks different from other responses we got

Trying the same query on the browser, I find - Image 9

When trying =FALSE, =FALSE* and =TRUE*,i get the debug message

Cheers to that! - Now to incorporate these into CTF's
