-We are not given a target/targets. Find it on your own

Having connected to the VPN, my IP=10.104.11.50

Now to find all hosts on this network subnet, using fping

Alive hosts:-
10.104.11.50
10.104.11.96
10.104.11.198


Now to explore the web servers on these hosts

I can connect to 10.104.11.96 but am unable to connect to 10.104.11.198.

Upon a Nmap scan, I find that 10.104.11.198 is a host, with port 80 not open

Opening up 10.104.11.96, we run a dirbuster scan, using common.txt

The description says that the login.php page is restricted. -Image D1

As dirbusteer keeps fuzzing, let's enumerate the results we got

At /staff/README.txt, I find - Image D2

As sure it was, I find an entry called /include/config.old.When traversing to that directory, I am met with a download prompt, for the config. old file. I download it

Catting the file, I find - Image D3
Now, it was suggested to use mysql

From a previous Nmap scan, I did find that 10.104.11.198 did have port 3306 running. We did try many methods of, logging in, but was denied.

Probably the password is wrong, but we do not find a leeway.
I had mentioned that I used common.txt, but in this case, the wordlist - directory-list-2.3.-small.txt would prove to be much more useful

From the fuzz results, the wordlist pulls up an entry called /signup.php

Visiting it, we are met with - Image D4

Now to just log in with our new credentials
We finally get in
Command - mysql -h 10.104.11.198 -u 'awdmgmt' -p

and then enter the password in the next prompt.

We are inside a MariaDB DB,version=5.5.38-0+wheezy1 (Debian)

Next, to show the databases
Command - show databases; - We find - Image D5

Now,to use awdmgmt_accounts
Command - use awdmgmt_accounts;

To show the available tables
Command - show tables;
We get - Image D5 (1)

Now, to display the contents from the table
Command - select * from accounts;

We finally get - Image D5 (2)
