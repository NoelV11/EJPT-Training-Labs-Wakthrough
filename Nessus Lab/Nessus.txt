
Nessus

I am not told where the machine lies, so i need to perform a f-ping scan.

First,we perform ip a s

IP Address=192.168.99.70
Fping to find other hosts

We get host=192.168.99.50
Firstly, we perform a full port service detection scan
Command - Nmap -sV 192.168.99.50 -p 0-65535 -vv.We get - Image N1

Now, we start Nessus, from the command line and after that head to https://localhost:8834

We find that no HTTP services run on the machines, so we select a Web App Scan
We click on a New Scan and fill up the details
-Image N2

and click on finish
Then we get - Image N2(1). Click on the play button to start the scan
Scan, generate reports in PDF form. We get Image N3
