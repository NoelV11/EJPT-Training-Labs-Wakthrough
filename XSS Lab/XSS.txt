Now to steal cookies of Admin's session

According to the lab description, the admin visits the website every 3-4 minutes

For this task, we require a specific webpage, with the website, to store the cookies.Fortunately, INE has just done that, giving us
192.168.99.11/get.php

We also have a jar.txt file at the same IP, to store cookie id's

First, let's infect the Feedback form with the cookie stealing script

As in - Image X6

Now, we wait on http://192.168.99.11/jar.txt and get - Image X6 (1)

or

Perform wget http://192.168.99.11/jar.txt
cat jar.txt - Image X6 (2)

Now, we need to change the current cookie id and set it to the captured admin's one.

Open Firebug - Go to cookies tab -Image X7
On the id field under Value, let's right-click and click on paste
It will open up - Image X7 (1)
