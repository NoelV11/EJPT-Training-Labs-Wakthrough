Burp Suite Lab

Problem Statement - A local police department has hired you to pentest their website. They had a new website created by a web development company and they want to make sure that everything is secure and in order.

Target IP = 10.100.13.5

I visit the site and find - Image B1
The site has 4 main webpages - /contact.html , /faq.html ,/blog.html and /home.html

When intercepting the request,using proxy.I do not find anything strange.No weird webpage names or parameters appear

Goal 1 - Explore the web application - done
Goal 2 -Configuring your arsenal -done 
My browser and proxy are on the gun

Now,to find the hidden pages - using dirbuster and common.txt
The primary directory we find is /assets
We get a overwhelming number of hits,considering duplicates of files stored in /assets - Image B2

Nothing of interest here

Goal - 3 - The Keystone

The automated mapping should have revealed a hidden path. Explore the path and extract useful information to reach your goal. You should note that developers are full of "magic tricks", find the one used in this application and you will find the keystone.

I guessed that the developers would not want to make the hidden path public,so i peek a look at /robots.txt
I find - Image B3

Taking the path,we enter it into the browser and find - Image B4

The extension path is /Y7gMEMZtin/login.php

Taking a look at the page source,I find - Image B5

Strange ,the page numbers keep on going,

Scrolling down,we finally find - Image B5 (1)

From the clue,I guess,we need to power up our proxy,intercept the initial login.php and then enter the parameters,to intercept once more

I first capture the /Y7gMEMZtin/login.php packet - Image B6

Now,we can do this in two ways.
1)->Enter the query string in the URL tab of the browser

or

2)Send the original captured packet to Repeater and edit the request from there

Taking 2'nd option

Intercept packet /Y7gMEMZtin/login.php - as in Image B6

Send the intercepted packet to Repeater
and then add the DEBUG paramter found from the page source - Image B7
We then click on send and get back the following response - Image B7 (1)

Now,we take option 1 and enter the URL extension in the browser - Image B8

The following page loads up - Image B8(1)

Yeah,that's pretty much it.
